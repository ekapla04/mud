There were a lot of changes, I have attempted to list them by file:

MudServer:
    - Added a single room to the map for testing
    - login_character and create_character create dummy characters for testing
        and load the basic command set

MudClientHandler:
    - Changed the way login works, now expecting a single string of a
        special format:
            - Returning characters: login // name // password
            - New characters: create // name // password // room
    - Updated excecute_command to actually execute the right command

Client:
    - Pretty sure I didn't do any changes in here

map.py:
    - Added a roomFromNameID function to create a room with a specified room id
        so that we can create and access rooms easily via a known id string
    - Added stubs for place and remove character
    - Added get_room function that get's a room based on it's id

character.py:
    - added functions to deal with messaging a user, and adding + using commands

room.py:
    - Implemented broadcast (message all characters except the sender),
        and broadcast_all (message all characters including the sender)
    - Added an itemLock to protect the items in a room (to gaurd against
        a situation where two characters try to get the same item at once)

commands.py:
    - Implemented a command class

basic_commands:
    - Implemented three basic commands
    - say - say something to peopl in the same room (done)
    - ping - for testing, just responds with pong
    - look - in progress, currently only shows the room description
