    - Server.py – Runs a server on localhost port 8000
        Run: python3 Server.py

    - Client.py – Connects to a server on localhost port 8000
        Run: python3 Client.py [host port]

What does the server do:
    This version of the server accepts connections from multiple clients,
    when clients send messages, the server sends them back in all caps.
    This is only a test, these need to be seriously rewritten (and better
    documented.)
