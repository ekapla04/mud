Hello! This is about how the new version of the server works!

Files:
    - MudServer.py : The server itself
    - MudClientHandler.py : The client handler created by the server when
        new users connect to the server
    - Client.py : The client used by users to communicate with the server


How to run:
    start server with -- python3 MudServer.py
    start client with -- python3 Client.py host port


----------- Message Protocol -----------

Both the client and server have dedicated send message and receive message
functions.
These are the only functions that should be used to communicate between 
client and server.
Messages are sent in two parts: 
    - the header: a number with size 16 that encodes the size of the message
    - the body: the actual text of the message

If there is non-text information we want to send back and forth (like color
to print given text) we can add that.


----------- Important Modules -----------

=== selectors ===

Library that allows you check for events on files and sockets. Used to tell
when a new message has arrived in the socket.

=== socketserver ===

Framework for creating a server that deals with a lot of the icky stuff behind
the scenes.
To use it, I've extended two of its base classes: the server (MudServer), and 
the request handler (MudClientHandler).
For each new connection to the server, a new thread runs the handle method of 
the request handler.
